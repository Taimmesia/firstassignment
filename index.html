  <h1>My Favourite Things</h1>
  <body>
    <h2>Rain</h2>
    <p>
      I love the petricher that the rain and the soil makes just before it
      rains. I love the smell of the roses just after the rain and I love the
      sound of the rain while I am snuggled in bed.

    <h2>Coffee</h2>
    <p>
      I love the smell of coffee when it's being brewed. But my absolute
      favourite type of coffee is a cappuccino. I really like how pretty it
      looks and how rich it tastes especially when it is paired with a
      croissant.

    <h2>Books</h2>
    <p>I like books because there's nothing better than a good book.</p>

    <h2>Summer</h2>
    <p>
      And lastly, since I moved to Sweden, I realised how much I took the hot
      summers in Zambia for granted. I didn't go to the pool or go out on a
      picnic as much as I should have. But now, in Sweden, some of the best
      things about the summer are blue skies, strawberries, warm weather,
      picnics, camping and trips to the beach.
